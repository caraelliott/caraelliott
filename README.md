I’m interested in JS, Python, AWS, HTML, CSS, machine learning and database management. </br>
I’m currently learning Software Developer fundamentals while working towards some Google IT Support and DevOps credentials and then hopefully undertake Cybersecurity training.</br>


My main interest in life is retro videogames but I am also fond of live music, film, art and philosophy.
