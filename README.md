I’m interested in JS, Python, AWS, HTML, CSS, machine learning, dev ops and database management. </br>
I’m currently learning Software Developer fundamentals, and will soon be moving onto DevOps and then hopefully Data Engineering or Cybersecurity training.</br>
I came from a Humanities background but have always loved technology and decided to pursue my passion.</br></br>

My main interest in life is retro videogames but I am also fond of live music, film, art and philosophy.
