I’m interested in JS, Python, AWS, HTML, CSS, machine learning, dev ops and database management.
I’m currently learning Software Developer fundamentals, and will soon be moving onto DevOps and then hopefully Data Engineering or Cybersecurity training.
I came from a Humanities background but have always loved technology and decided to pursue my passion.

My main interest in life is retro videogames but I am also fond of live music, film, art and philosophy.
